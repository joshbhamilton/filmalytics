  _aioseop_description: How can we confidently compare two movies? Introducing Film
    Success Rating and 2013's Best Summer Movies.
---
### The Process

We love to compare - we list our top movies of the year, we decide between multiple movies on  a Friday night, or we argue about how much better the original was than the remake.

But is there an analytical process we can follow to actually determine the best movies of the summer?

Sports has been tackling this problem for ages. We even have a movie highlighting baseball's move towards using stats to evaluate players (thanks ***Moneyball***!). Sabermetricians, the baseball-lovers who apply statistics to baseball, tout the ability to compare any two players based on an aggregate of their hitting and fielding statistics, creating a measure that estimates how many runs they create per game or how much a player contributes to their team.

<h2><!--more--></h2>

Want to compare Buster Posey's worth to Miguel Cabrera's? The WAR values, an estimate of how many wins a player creates, say Miguel Cabrera creates approximately three extra wins than Buster Posey. We're able to confidently say which player was better than another, based on fairly easy to understand concepts.

Comparing two movies is a little more difficult. There is no clear idea of "wins" or "points." If someone asks you what was the most successful film of 2012, you could choose the Best Picture winner or the Highest Box Office Gross or some other criteria for determining. It's unclear how ***Toy Story 3*** compares to ***Apocalypse Now***.

In film, the measure of success is derived from several areas. Studios aim to produce profitable films so that they can continue to make movies. Audiences are looking for a film they can enjoy and that connects with them. Critics are looking for movies that fulfill the artistic potential that a story, acting, and visuals can provide. And filmmakers, actors, directors, writers, etc. are looking for a combination of these things - and the ability to create more projects in the future.

In comparing movies, we'll create a metric that encompasses all of these factors into one, what we'll call the Film Success Rating (FSR). It includes:

<ul>
	<li><strong>Profitability</strong> - what percentage of the movie's budget did the film make back</li>
	<li><strong>Audience Love</strong> - a combination of several audience ratings to determine if the audience felt it was worth the price of admission</li>
	<li><strong>Critic Appreciation</strong> - a measure of the critics' review and thoughts on the quality of a film</li>
</ul>

This metric is based on a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 being a perfect score. In the future, these factors can be expanded to include number of theaters, weekly box office results, future success of creators, and more. Now onto the results for this summer!

###Top 10 Movies of Summer 2013

#### 1. <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/before_midnight_2013/">Before Midnight</a> - Film Success Rating: <span style="color: #ff0000;">93.56</span>

For most, describing a perfect summer movie would include a movie franchise, a unique location, characters with remarkable skills, some tense conflict, and a cliffhanger for a potential sequel. This year we get that perfect combination in ***Before Midnight***, a non-superhero movie that has topped the list of summer movies. The third in the ***Before*** series from Richard Linklater has its "superhero" characters Jesse and Celeste venturing through the Greek countryside, highlighting their amazing skills of walking while engaging in in-depth conversations that lead to a major meltdown. Currently, this is the second in Film Success Rating in the franchise, behind ***Before Sunrise*** (94.22) and ahead of ***Before Sunset*** (92.24).

#### 2. <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/20_feet_from_stardom/">20 Feet From Stardom</a> - Film Success Rating: <span style="color: #ff0000;">92.90</span>

This documentary about background singers is the lone documentary to crack the Top 10. ***20 Feet From Stardom*** follows the typical pattern of ranking fairly high amongst critics and slightly lower amongst audiences, but truly differentiates itself by being profitable. (Note: Many of the documentaries do not have published budgets so their final profit is unknown). This was the second-highest grossing documentary, earning a little over $4 million and falling behind ***Kevin Hart: Let Me Explain*** with $32 million.

#### 3. <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fruitvale_station/">Fruitvale Station</a> - Film Success Rating: <span style="color: #ff0000;">91.74</span>

The only drama in the Top 10, Ryan Coogler's first feature film as writer-director has been a huge success amongst critics and is slowly finding its ways to audiences. Critics began hailing this movie back at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival and the film has recently begun to spread to nearly one thousand theaters (compared to ***Star Trek Into Darkness*** which opened in about four thousand theaters). This is also the shortest of the non-documentary films released this summer, packing more emotional tensity in its scant 84 minutes than any other film this summer.

#### 4. <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/star_trek_into_darkness/">Star Trek Into Darkness</a> - Film Success Rating: <span style="color: #ff0000;">90.09</span>

Is there an actor that studios are more excited to announce in their franchise than Benedict Cumberbatch? The Sherlock star and upcoming contributor to <strong>FOUR</strong> films this fall was a much hyped addition to the ***Star Trek Into Darkness*** cast. While ***Star Trek Into Darkness*** scored remarkably high with critics and audiences, the movie was a slight decrease from the previous ***Star Trek*** (92.24) and made a <b><i>measly</i></b> $227 million compared to ***Star Trek***'s $257 million.

#### 5. <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_way_way_back/">The Way, Way Back</a> - Film Success Rating: <span style="color: #ff0000;">88.44</span>
Nat Faxon and Jim Rash, two familiar faces from ***Ben &amp; Kate*** and ***Community***, were first-time directors in this water-park set coming-of-age story. To get a true sense of accomplishment, compare ***The Way, Way Back*** with ***Adventureland***, the 2009 coming-of-age film starring Jesse Eisenberg that took place in a theme park, and ***The Descendants***, the 2011 Oscar-winning screenplay by Nat Faxon and Jim Rash.

***The Way, Way Back*** was slightly less critically acclaimed, but seemed to find a higher appreciation with audiences. In both ***The Way, Way Back*** and ***The Descendants***, Faxon and Rash seem to have a writing style that appeals to both critics and audiences. This also statistically proves that water parks are a much better coming-of-age setting than theme parks.

#### 6. <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_conjuring/">The Conjuring</a> - Film Success Rating: <span style="color: #ff0000;">88.28</span>

Horror movies are not typically a successful summer movie genre - which is what makes ***The Conjuring*** so impressive on all levels. Only 10 horror films have a Critics Score of higher than 80% since 2010. ***The Conjuring*** is also the first horror movie since ***What Lies Beneath*** to finish in the Top 10 Box Office results of the summer - and that was in 2000!

#### 7. <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/much_ado_about_nothing_2012/">Much Ado About Nothing</a> - Film Success Rating: <span style="color: #ff0000;">87.29</span>

Joss Whedon has become the biggest name in summer movies since Steven Spielberg. ***The Avengers***, ***Cabin in the Woods*** (technically released in April), and this year's ***Much Ado About Nothing*** all involved Whedon's hand in some combination of writing and directing. The question is - should Whedon continue his run of quick-witted superhero movies, or should he continue the path of adapting the Bard's tales with a nice contemporary twist? Alas, ***The Avengers*** comes out with an FSR of 91.74, compared to 87.29 for both ***The Cabin in the Woods*** and ***Much Ado About Nothing***. More superheroes to come, but perhaps we can suggest an addition of old English or Nathan Fillion to the next comic book romp?

#### 8. <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/this_is_the_end/">This Is the End</a> - Film Success Rating: <span style="color: #ff0000;">87.29</span>

Is it possible that a stoner-comedy about the apocalypse can be more appreciated by critics than audiences?

Critics seemed to be humored by the movie's self-awareness and nearly all of the positive reviews mention something related to the movie's "self." The film was self-referential, self-mocking, self-congratulatory, and self-involved according to the critics.

Audiences tend to love great cameos in comedies, and this film was packed full of them. First-time directors Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg were able to blend the dozens of young Hollywood appearances with a focus on a set of friendships that might not survive the impending apocalypse. Now, if only we were able to get ratings for Pineapple Express 2 (shown in the middle of ***This is the End*** as a homemade video while the guys are trapped).

#### 9. <a style="font-size: 1em;" href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/monsters_university/">Monsters University</a> - Film Success Rating: <span style="color: #ff0000;">85.31</span>

Pixar brought back Mike and Sully for this prequel to 2001's ***Monster's Inc.*** This is the third series that Pixar has developed a second film in the series for. ***Toy Story 2*** had a slight decrease in FSR from ***Toy Story***, but then ***Toy Story 3*** had an FSR higher than both films. ***Cars 2*** was Pixar's largest failure to date, and had a 23% drop in FSRs between films. ***Monsters University*** had a 7% drop from ***Monster's Inc.***, which is acceptable. Critics Scores are the biggest swing of these franchises, so it'll be interesting to watch how they handle ***Finding Dory***, the sequel to ***Finding Nemo***, when it releases in 2015.

#### 10. <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/despicable_me_2/">Despicable Me 2</a> - Film Success Rating: <span style="color: #ff0000;">85.14</span>

Take nearly the exact same cast, the exact same director and writer team - should you expect the same results for the second film? In 2010's ***Despicable Me*** we were introduced to villainous Gru and his attempts to become the baddest super villain of them all - if only those three adorable orphan girls don't sideline him. The movie turned out to be a success, generating an FSR of 85.64. This year we get a similar setup, only Gru is out to stop other villains and nearly the exact same FSR of 85.14. Next up, a ***Minions*** spin-off for December 2014.
