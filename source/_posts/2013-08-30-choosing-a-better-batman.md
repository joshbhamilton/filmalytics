    have played Batman.

Last week the movie world was set abuzz with the announcement that Ben Affleck will star as Batman in 2015's Batman-Superman movie. Message boards filled up with doubts, Matt Damon and Michael Keaton gave their support, and [national petitions](http://www.change.org/petitions/warner-brothers-remove-ben-affleck-as-batman-bruce-wayne-in-the-superman-batman-movie?share_id=sULaHufwNf) were launched in an attempt to stop Mr. Boston from becoming Mr. Gotham.

But what makes a good superhero? Are there certain traits that assure us that this brave, masked actor can save us from the super villains?

### What Determines a Good Superhero


Let's make things very simple - a superhero can either be Good (Tobey Maguire's ***Spiderman***), or Bad (Seth Rogen's ***The Green Hornet***).

<h2><!--more--></h2>

To start our analysis of superheroes, we need to first examine the qualities of past superheroes. I pulled a list of 25 actors who portrayed a superhero and analyzed their first appearance in a superhero movie, ranging from Christopher Reeve's ***Superman*** in 1978 to most recently Henry Cavil's ***Man of Steel***.

To determine if they were a Good or Bad Superhero, I calculated the FSR for their first superhero movie (to review FSR, read [last week's post](/2013/08/23/introducing-fsr-and-top-10-movies-of-summer/). This will give us a score of **0-100** of how successful the film was with critics, audiences, and financially. An actor earns a label as a Good Superhero if they have an FSR of 75 or higher.

Then we can look at traits of these two groups to see what we have in common:
<ul>
	<li>Beware of actors with a good film career. In the movies leading up to their superhero debuts, Bad Superheroes had higher average FSR (**61.38**) for their movies than Good Superheroes (**51.66**).</li>
	<li>Bad Superheroes spend a lot of time on TV. The average number of appearances on a TV episode for Bad Superheroes is **59.3** episodes compared to **41.2** episodes for Good Superheroes.</li>
	<li>The average age for a superhero is 34, for both Good and Bad. Good Superheroes tend to have a wider range of ages than Bad Superheroes.</li>
	<li>Short Superhero Syndrome? 22% of Bad Superheroes are less than six feet tall, while 50% of Good Superheroes are under six feet.</li>
</ul>
Let's also look at the directors that Good and Bad Superheroes worked with previously. Some directors (and their casting directors) seem to have a unique ability in casting future superheroes in their non-superhero movies.
<h4>Directors Who Cast Good Superheroes in Non-Superhero Movies:</h4>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Stuart Baird</strong> - Halle Berry (<em><strong>Executive Decision</strong></em>), Robert Downey, Jr. (<em><strong>U.S. Marshals</strong></em>), Ron Perlman (<em><strong>Star Trek - Nemesis</strong></em>), Wesley Snipes (<em><strong>U.S. Marshals</strong></em>)</li>
	<li><strong>David Fincher</strong> -  Andrew Garfield (<em><strong>The Social Network</strong></em>),  Robert Downey Jr. (<em><strong>Zodiac</strong></em>)</li>
	<li><strong>Curtis Hanson</strong> -  Robert Downey Jr. (<em><strong>Lucky You</strong></em>), Tobey Maguire (<em><strong>Wonder Boys</strong></em>)</li>
	<li><strong>Terry Gilliam</strong> - Tobey Maguire (<em><strong>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</strong></em>), Andrew Garfield (<em><strong>The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus</strong></em>)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Directors Who Cast Bad Superheroes in Non-Superhero Movies:</h4>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Oliver Stone</strong> - Nicolas Cage (<em><strong>World Trade Center</strong></em>), Val Kilmer (<em><strong>The Doors</strong></em>), Alec Baldwin (<em><strong>Talk Radio</strong></em>)</li>
	<li><strong>Woody Allen</strong> - Alec Baldwin (<em><strong>Alice</strong></em>), Edward Norton (<em><strong>Everyone Says I Love You</strong></em>), Jennifer Garner (<em><strong>Deconstructing Harry</strong></em>)</li>
	<li><strong>Michael Bay</strong> - Nicolas Cage (<em><strong>The Rock</strong></em>), Ben Affleck (<em><strong>Armageddon</strong></em>), Jennifer Garner (<em><strong>Pearl Harbor</strong></em>)</li>
	<li><strong>Ridley Scott</strong> - Nicolas Cage (<em><strong>Matchstick Men</strong></em>), Edward Norton (<em><strong>Kingdom of Heaven</strong></em>), Eric Bana (<em><strong>Black Hawk Down</strong></em>)</li>
</ul>
Last, let's examine the genre profiles. We can look at an actor's body of work and see what types of movies they tend to appear in. Good and Bad Superheroes have these genre profiles:

Good Superheroes tend to appear in more Action movies than Comedies, more Sci-Fi than Romance, and a large majority of Dramatic work. Bad Superheroes are Comedic and less Action-oriented, Romantic and not SciFi, and also fairly Dramatic.

Now that we know a few things that distinguish a good superhero from a bad one, let's use this to determine who should play our next Batman in 2015.

### Choosing a New Bruce Wayne

We need a list of potential actors to start our search. We'll start by using the cast lists from two of the directors above, David Fincher and Curtis Hanson. Both directors have a good eye for superhero talent and have recent works for us to pull from.

Around 70 male actors have appeared in a Fincher or Hanson film. This ranges from up-and-comers to seasoned vets. To narrow this list down, we'll focus on all actors who are between the age of 26 and 54, the range we observed for our Good Superheroes.

<em style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>Notably Removed: </strong>Chris Cooper, Christopher Plummer, Ed Asner, James Cromwell, and Steve Martin.</em>

This leaves us with 41 names. In this list, there are a handful of actors who either played a superhero previously or are currently starring in movies as this character. We've seen a few actors take on multiple superhero roles, but the results have been murky. Halle Berry first starred as Storm in the successful <em><strong>X-Men</strong></em> series, but then had an epic fail with <em><strong>Catwoman</strong></em>. Chris Evans started out as Johnny Storm in <em><strong>Fantastic Four</strong></em> before upgrading to <em><strong>Captain America</strong></em>.

So while it is possible, we probably don't want our Batman to have other Batcaves to wander to when he's not filming. Let's remove the actors with other franchises to their name, leaving us with 34 names.

<span style="color: #3366ff;"><em><strong>Notably Removed: </strong>Andrew Garfield, Daniel Craig, Edward Norton, Eric Bana, Mark Ruffalo, Nicolas Cage, Robert Downey, Jr.</em></span>

Finally, let's compare an actor's filmography to see if they tend to appear in similar films as our Good Superheroes. We'll do this by seeing if their genre profile appears to be more Action-packed and less Romantic Comedy. We can then classify if an actor would be a Good Superhero or a Bad Superhero.

### The Verdict

From our list above we can narrow down and get a <strong>Top 10 Wish List for Batman</strong>. Paul Bettany, our #1, would be difficult to see as Batman but has proven he can play a great villain. Guy Pearce, #2 above, is my top choice. Pearce has the gritty, growling voice that fans have come to admire in Bale's Batman performance and has the perfect blend of familiarity but not uber-celebrity. Other names include Crudup and Brolin, rumored to be on the short list for the caped crusader.

Interestingly enough, Affleck was classified as a Bad Superhero and would have ranked near the bottom of this list. Over half of his movies are labeled Comedy and a quarter of them Romantic - not the recipe to make a successful crusader as we've seen in the past.

It'll be tough for Affleck to win the hearts of Gotham City. Not only will he be replacing one of the most popular portrayals of a character in the last decade, but he'll be going up against the trends of superhero cinema.

Who on this list would you most like to see drive the Batmobile? Any other names missing that could fill the boots?
