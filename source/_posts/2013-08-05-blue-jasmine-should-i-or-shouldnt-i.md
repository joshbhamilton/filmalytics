Is it possible to put my love and admiration of Woody Allen to numbers? From the first time I caught a double-screening of <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bananas/">Bananas</a> and <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/annie_hall/">Annie Hall</a>, I knew that we would have a long-term relationship. The blend of screwball comedy with intellectualism (and often mocking intellectualism) brought me into the beautiful streets of Manhattan and had me longing to watch Ingmar Bergman films to understand Woody more.

As I began to devour his decades of work, I quickly came to realize that not every film was as enrapturing as <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/manhattan/">Manhattan</a>. I'll never forget the day I put <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/scoop/">Scoop</a> in my DVD player and spent the rest of the afternoon depressed. There are the occasions when a Woody Allen film leaves you wanting so much more, to feel the connection with neurotic characters roaming the streets of New York joking about Freud and the Yankees.

This week Woody's latest film, <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blue_jasmine/">Blue Jasmine</a>, is being expanded out to more theaters, including here in San Francisco. My task: put on my best tweed jacket and listen to <strong><em>Rhapsody in Blue</em></strong> and determine if Blue Jasmine is worth the $12.50 for a ticket.

###The Legend

There's no doubt Woody Allen is one of America's most unique voices of filmmaking. Since 1969, he has released at least <strong>one movie every single year</strong> except for four: 1974, 1976, 1981, and 1988. This is like getting the perfect attendance award except instead of dealing with gym class and algebra, you're writing, shooting, editing and releasing a movie. No one else comes even close to Woody's consistency and work ethic (yeah, we're on a first name basis now).

However, for all the years of greatness, Woody Allen is not without his busts. Someone who has recently come to discover Woody would find it hard to imagine the writer/director of <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/to_rome_with_love/">To Rome with Love</a> as a voice of American cinema.

Personally, watching a Woody Allen film is like catching up with a friend from college who you talk to once a year. After every meeting, you critique how they have changed and grown, but you still have this desire to be back in their presence more often than your annual visit.

Woody has an overall average of <strong>74%</strong> on Rotten Tomatoes for all his work - making him Certified Fresh for 40+ years of work.

Let's take a look at Mr. Allen through the decades. Here's the breakdown of average ratings for his movies directed by decade.

Woody had a remarkable first decade to his career - with classics like <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/annie_hall/">Annie Hall</a> (<strong>98%</strong>) and <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/manhattan/">Manhattan</a> (<strong>98%</strong>) in a three year stretch. When the worst rated movie <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/interiors/">Interiors</a> (<strong>77%</strong>) is still nominated for 5 Oscars, its a testament to how quickly and profoundly Woody found his voice and technique.

In the first half of the 2000s, Woody had a stretch of films from <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/curse_of_the_jade_scorpion/">The Curse of the Jade Scorpion</a> (<strong>45%</strong>) to <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/anything_else/">Anything Else</a> (<strong>40%</strong>),  that failed to connect. <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/match_point/">Match Point</a> (<strong>77%</strong>) started a comeback that led to an improved rating in 2000s and gave momentum in 2010s.

With this in mind, Blue Jasmine's current score of <strong>86%</strong> gives confidence that this film is an above-average Woody Allen film, especially for the post-2000s filmography. It may not be as highly esteemed as a 1970s or 1980s piece, but any Allen-ite will appreciate visiting his unique world.

###The Muse

When I first heard of the casting for this movie, one area of concern was <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/cate_blanchett/">Cate Blanchett</a> as the leading actress. Don't get me wrong - Cate is a fantastic actress with some extremely impressive roles. But when I think Cate Blanchett, I'm not necessarily thinking comedy.

So let's look at some of the other fantastic actresses that have starred in Woody Allen films - do they all come from strong comedic backgrounds?

</table>
First of all - can we just remark at the incredible start to <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/diane_keaton/">Diane Keaton's</a> career?  <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lovers_and_other_strangers/">Lovers and Other Strangers</a> (<strong>100%</strong>), <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/play_it_again_sam/">Play It Again, Sam</a> (97%), <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/godfather/">The Godfather</a> (<strong>100%</strong>), <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sleeper/">Sleeper</a> (<strong>100%</strong>), <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/godfather_part_ii/">The Godfather, Part II</a> (<strong>98%</strong>), <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/love_and_death/">Love and Death</a> (<strong>100%</strong>), and then <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/annie_hall/">Annie Hall</a> (<strong>98%</strong>) and <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/manhattan/">Manhattan</a> (<strong>98%</strong>) a few years later.

Second, when comparing Cate Blanchett to the rest of the these stars, we see that she's got ratings second to only <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/judy_davis/">Judy Davis</a>. While this is a sign of a great career, the Woody films with Judy Davis are not fan favorites (outside of <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1040798-husbands_and_wives/">Husbands and Wives</a>). Could it be that Blanchett will follow in the footsteps of Davis and produce good, but not great, Woody-memories?

Also, I think its quite a sign of the chemistry and impact that Woody and these actresses had together. The ratings difference in Woody Allen movies and Non-Woody movies is pretty shocking. In addition, after starring in multiple comedies with him, these stars went on to do dozens of other comedies, but most of them to pretty low scores.

###The Cast

Blue Jasmine has a cast that includes <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/cate_blanchett/">Cate Blanchett</a>, <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/alec_baldwin/">Alec Baldwin</a>, <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/louis_ck/">Louis C.K.</a>, <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/peter_sarsgaard/">Peter Sarsgaard</a>, <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/andrew_dice_clay/">Andrew Dice Clay</a>, <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/sally_hawkins/">Sally Hawkins</a>, <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/alden-ehrenreich/">Alden Ehrenreich</a>, and <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/michael_stuhlbarg/">Michael Stuhlbarg</a>.

Notably missing from this list is Woody Allen himself. In the 44 movies directed, Woody appears in <strong>31 of them</strong>. Movies where Woody directs and acts in them have an average rating of <strong>77%</strong>, compared to <strong>68%</strong> for those he simply directs. However, comparing the last 5 movies he directed and acted in (<a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/to_rome_with_love/">To Rome with Love</a>, <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/scoop/">Scoop</a>, <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/anything_else/">Anything Else</a>, <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hollywood_ending/">Hollywood Ending</a>, and <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/curse_of_the_jade_scorpion/">The Curse of the Jade Scorpion</a>) had an average rating of <strong>43%</strong> compared to those he simply directed (<a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/midnight_in_paris/">Midnight in Paris</a>, <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/you_will_meet_a_tall_dark_stranger/">You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger</a>, <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/whatever_works/">Whatever Works</a>, <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/vicky_cristina_barcelona/">Vicky Christina Barcelona</a>, and <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cassandras_dream/">Cassandra's Dream</a>) with an average of <strong>63%</strong>.

The fact that Woody is not acting in this film saddens this nostalgic fan, but compared to the trend of recent movies, probably gives Blue Jasmine a higher chance of being enjoyable.

Let's look at the total average rating and average rating for last 5 movies for the cast:

</table>
Blanchett and Sarsgaard have had a fairly consistent run of picking decent movies with a few big misses (<a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/good_german/">The Good German</a> at <strong>33%</strong> for Blanchett, <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/770677993/">The Green Lantern</a> at <strong>26%</strong> for Sarsgaard). Baldwin has fewer high ratings outside of television, with lots of kid's movies thrown in the mix. Louis C.K. and Andrew Dice Clay really get a pass for these average ratings - as stand up comedians, their filmography is pretty slim (and doesn't account for Louis C.K.'s phenomenal TV show).

One interesting name that stands out is Sally Hawkins, with an average rating of <strong>75%</strong>. The star of <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1195103-happy_go_lucky/">Happy-Go-Lucky</a> (<strong>93%</strong>) has had a remarkable filmography and this makes her an intriguing addition to the cast.

Lastly, it's interesting to see if these actors &amp; directors have worked together in the past:

</tbody>
</table>
With an average of <strong>69%</strong>, this looks like a decent chemistry could exist amongst the cast and gives a vote of confidence for Blue Jasmine.

###Other Tidbits:
<ul>
	<li>Javier Aguirresarobe returns as the cinematographer for Blue Jasmine. He previously was the cinematographer for <strong><em>Vicky Christina Barcelona</em></strong> (<strong>82%</strong>).</li>
	<li><em><strong>Blue Jasmine</strong></em> will be the fourth Woody Allen movie released in July. Others include <strong><em>Scoop</em></strong>, <em><strong>Zelig</strong></em>, and <em><strong>A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy</strong></em>.</li>
	<li>This is not Woody Allen's first movie to take place in San Francisco. Woody's first film, <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/take_the_money_and_run/">Take the Money and Run</a>, was filmed in San Francisco and he starred in <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/play_it_again_sam/">Play It Again, Sam</a>, which also took place here.</li>
</ul>

###The Verdict

To be honest, they could show a four-hour screening of Woody Allen running errands and I'd show up to watch.  The current Rotten Tomatoes score and the cast potential are encouraging, and Cate Blanchett could give us a fantastic performance like Judy Davis's role in Husbands and Wives. Add in the extra benefit of seeing my city and neighborhood captured with Mr. Allen's eye and I'll be more than happy to pay the $12.50 for a few hours of entertainment.

For anyone else watching Blue Jasmine this weekend, I encourage you to visit earlier Woody Allen films (<a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/crimes_and_misdemeanors/">Crimes and Misdemeanors</a>, <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/annie_hall/">Annie Hall</a>, or <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bananas/">Bananas</a> ) as a good comparison.
