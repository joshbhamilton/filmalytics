Back in 2009, in an effort to attract more interest in the Academy Awards, the Academy announced they would expand the Best Picture nominees from 5 to 10. The previous year's nominees was criticized for leaving out fan-favorites like <strong><em>The Dark Knight</em></strong> in exchange for higher-brow works like <em><strong>The Reader</strong></em> and <em><strong>Frost/Nixon</strong></em>.

One film to get the bump from this change was an independent sci-fi movie from South Africa titled <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/district_9/"><em><strong>District 9</strong></em></a>. The movie combined powerful political themes and impressive special effects. Even more impressive - this was director Neill Blomkamp's first major film. While <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/district_9/"><em><strong>District 9</strong></em></a> did not win Best Picture this year, it still gave fans a new name to watch for interesting sci-fi movies.

This past weekend, Blomkamp's latest effort, <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/elysium_2013/"><em><strong>Elysium</strong></em></a>, was released in theaters. While winning the box office for the weekend, critics have been quick to yawn at this effort in comparison to <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/district_9/"><em><strong>District 9</strong></em></a>.

Is it possible that Blomkamp suffers from a post-Best Picture hangover effect? How does <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/elysium_2013/"><em><strong>Elysium</strong></em></a> compare to other films following Oscar-nominated efforts? Do other first-time directors who have their work celebrated have a similar downturn on their second efforts?

###The Process

To answer these questions, I've pulled together a list of all Best Picture nominated films and their directors. There have been 503 films nominated for Best Picture since 1927. Almost 300 different directors have had their work honored by the Academy. To make this process a little bit simpler, I focused on directors who were nominated from 1990-2012 and removed animated films from the selection.

I've also created a combination of ratings from two popular sites: Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB. I calculated a simple average of the Rotten Tomatoes Critics Rating, Rotten Tomatoes Audience Rating, and IMDB Rating to reduce any potential bias the ratings might have. For example, <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/district_9/"><em><strong>District 9</strong></em></a> has a 90% RT Critics Rating, a 79% RT Audience Rating, and a 8.0 at IMDB for an overall combined rating of 83.00 (90+79+8.0*10/3).

###Best Picture Nominee Hangover?

To see if there is a lingering effect from being nominated for Best Picture, we can look at the directors follow-up film. For the 130 films and 94 directors nominated since 1990, we pull the ratings for the nominated film and for the subsequent effort.

Let's now look at the average percent change in ratings from these Best Picture nominated films to their follow-ups:

<td valign="top">-11%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Combined</td>
<td valign="top">-19%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
For their follow-up films, these films are averaging a combined rating of 59.25 (compared to 82.77 for the nominated film). There does appear to be some truth to the idea of a hangover effect for directors with a Best Picture nominated film. Who are the worst offenders, you ask?

This seems about right - a couple of misguided remakes, Keanu Reeves as an energy scientist, and the movie recently rated as <a href="http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2012/06/the-50-harshest-roger-ebert-movie-review-quotes/north">Roger Ebert's Harshest Movie Review</a>.

</tbody>

All of these follow-up films, except for <em><strong>Almost Famous</strong></em>, were nominated again for Best Picture. In fact, almost 21% of the follow-up films were nominated for a Best Picture. The approach to follow-up films seems to be like a power hitter in baseball - either they are going to hit a home run or they are going to strike out swinging and leave all of us stranded on the bases.

####How does Elysium compare?

Here's the ratings for Blomkamp's two films:
<table width="586.0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top"></td>
<td valign="top">District 9</td>
<td valign="top">Elysium</td>
<td valign="top">% Change</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">RT Critics</td>
<td valign="top">90</td>
<td valign="top">66</td>
<td valign="top">-26.67%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">RT Audience</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Combination</td>
<td valign="top">83.00</td>
<td valign="top">72</td>
<td valign="top">-13.25%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
The combined ratings dropped 13.25%. This would put it 45th of the follow-up films, right behind Jonathan Dayton &amp; Valerie Faris's <em><strong>Ruby Sparks</strong></em> (dropped 13%) and just ahead of Clint Eastwood's <em><strong>A Perfect World</strong></em> (dropped 14%). Unfortunately for Blomkamp, only two films have ever had this size of drop and been nominated again for Best Picture, <strong><em>Les Miserables</em></strong> at -15% and <strong><em>Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close</em></strong> at -19% (both of which are adapted from books, coincidence?).

###Fellow Rookies

One of the most talked about stories with <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/district_9/"><strong><em>District 9</em></strong></a> was that it was director Neil Blomkamp's first feature film. Legend has it that Peter Jackson was so impressed with several of Blomkamp's short films that he hired him to direct the video-game inspired film <strong><em>Halo</em></strong>. When financing for <strong><em>Halo</em></strong> fell through, they decided to extend Blomkamp's short film <strong><em>Alive in Joburg</em></strong> and turn it into a full-length feature.

Blomkamp isn't the lone rookie director to have a film get nominated for Best Picture. Twelve other directors have achieved this feat since 1990.

Let's compare the average percent change for Rookie Directors and Experienced Directors:
<table width="586.0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top"></td>
<td valign="top">Rookies</td>
<td valign="top">Experienced</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">RT Critics</td>
<td valign="top">-29%</td>
<td valign="top">-24%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">RT Audience</td>
<td valign="top">-12%</td>
<td valign="top">-18%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">IMDB</td>
<td valign="top">-8%</td>
<td valign="top">-11%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Combined</td>
<td valign="top">-17%</td>
<td valign="top">-18%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
Blomkamp's decrease of 13% is a little better than average. Remarkably, only Bennett Miller followed up his Best Picture nominated film, <strong><em>Capote</em></strong>, with a higher rated film, <em><strong>Moneyball</strong></em>.

###Conclusion

<a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/elysium_2013/"><em><strong>Elysium</strong></em></a> appears to fit within the rank of movies that are enjoyable and worthy of viewing, but are neither a flop nor a mega-hit. This movie also seems to follow the trend where we see that there are signs of a Best Picture Hangover occurring for directors and that Rookie Directors who get nominated struggle to improve in their second film.
